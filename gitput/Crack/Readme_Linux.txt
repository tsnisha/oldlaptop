   set COMSOL_NUM_NUMA=<number of sockets> or COMSOL_NUM_NUMA=1 for ordinary PC to 
   avoid error at startup:

     export COMSOL_NUM_NUMA=1
     ./setup

2. Select "_SolidSQUAD_/LMCOMSOL_Multiphysics_SSQ.lic" to install COMSOL Multiphysics
   --or--
   Select "_SolidSQUAD_/LMCOMSOL_Server_SSQ.lic" to install COMSOL Server

3. Select Components, Installation folder and options.
   At installation step "Options" untick "Check for updates after installation" and
